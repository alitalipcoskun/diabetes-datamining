# Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Data Preprocessing
This step contains feature selection, feature extraction and dimentionality reduction.

## Data Mining
The machine learning models are used in this section for reaching out to the patterns of the data.

## Data Postprocessing
The visualizations and data representations are done in here. After this step, the target information may be reached.
