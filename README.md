# Purpose of this Notebook
This notebook is created by me to  review the topics I have seen in Data Mining course.

``environment.yml`` file is available at the root directory of the project.

To create an environment with the file that is located on this repository, run the following command line:


```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Dataset
The dataset is obtained from ``kaggle``.
The link is here: ``https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset``


# Data Mining Course Review
Data mining is a process to obtain meaningful patterns from data.

## Data Preprocessing
This step contains feature selection, feature extraction and dimentionality reduction.

## Data Mining
The machine learning models are used in this section for reaching out to the patterns of the data.

## Data Postprocessing
The visualizations and data representations are done in here. After this step, the target information may be reached.
